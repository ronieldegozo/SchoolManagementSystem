## School Management System using NodeJS with MySQL

A School Management System is an information management system for educational institutions to manage all student's data. It provides abilities such as registration of students in classes, documenting of grades and analytical marks of each student and other evaluation elements.

School Management systems vary in size, scope, and abilities, from packages implemented in relatively small organizations to cover student records only, to enterprise-wide solutions, which aim to cover most aspects of the operation of large organizations and their online schools with significant local responsibility.
